# Fitbit Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of Fitbit data, focusing on activity levels and sleep patterns. The analysis aims to derive insights into users' behavior and provide valuable information for promoting health and wellness.

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes two primary datasets:
- **Activity Data**: Contains information about daily activity levels, including steps taken, distance traveled, and active minutes.
- **Sleep Data**: Includes data on users' sleep patterns, such as total sleep duration and time spent in bed.

## Analysis
The analysis covers the following aspects:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and trends in activity and sleep data.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables, such as activity levels and calories burnt.
- Demographic analysis to explore how activity and sleep patterns vary across different groups, such as gender.

## Insights
Key insights derived from the analysis include:
- Strong positive correlation between total steps, active minutes, and calories burnt.
- Variation in activity levels throughout the week, with Tuesday being the most active day.
- Analysis of sleep duration and quality, highlighting average sleep duration and variations across different days of the week.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
4. Execute the code cells to run the analysis and visualize the results.
